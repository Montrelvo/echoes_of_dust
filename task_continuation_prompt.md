# Task Continuation Prompt for "Echoes of Dust" Development

## I. Project Context

The "Echoes of Dust" game project is currently focused on developing tools to process a tile atlas (`Atlas file to game data/Complete File for All Tiles.png`) for use in its map and bestiary features. The overall goal is to convert this visual atlas into structured JSON data that the game can consume.

## II. Summary of Recent Progress & Current State

1. **Initial Game Logic Refactoring:**
    * The original monolithic `script.js` was refactored into multiple modular JavaScript files (e.g., `gameState.js`, `gameLoop.js`, `displayController.js`, etc.).
    * `index.html` was updated to load these new modules.
    * The old `script.js` was archived to `archive/script_old_2025-05-11.js`.
    * Documentation created: `refactor_log_script_js.md` and `game_features_and_roadmap.md`.

2. **Atlas Processing - Stage 1: Metadata Template Generation:**
    * A Node.js script, `Atlas file to game data/atlas_coordinate_lister.js`, was created.
    * **Purpose:** To read `Atlas file to game data/Complete File for All Tiles.png` (a 32x32 tile atlas) and generate `Atlas file to game data/atlas_metadata_template.json`. This template pre-fills (x,y) coordinates for each tile, requiring the user to manually input `id`, `name`, `type`, `tags`, `creatureId`, etc.
    * **Dependency:** `pngjs` (npm package).

3. **Atlas Processing - Stage 1.5: Visual Metadata Editor (Current Focus):**
    * To facilitate easier editing of the `atlas_metadata_template.json`, a web-based visual editor was developed:
        * [`Atlas file to game data/atlas_editor.html`](Atlas%20file%20to%20game%20data/atlas_editor.html)
        * [`Atlas file to game data/atlas_editor.js`](Atlas%20file%20to%20game%20data/atlas_editor.js)
    * **Features of `atlas_editor.html`:**
        * Loads the atlas image (`Complete File for All Tiles.png`).
        * Loads a JSON metadata file (e.g., `atlas_metadata_template.json`).
        * Displays the atlas on a canvas with a grid.
        * Allows selection of tiles by clicking the canvas or a list entry.
        * Displays a zoomed-in preview of the selected tile.
        * Provides an editing panel for the selected tile's metadata (`id`, `name`, `type`, `x`, `y`, `creatureId`, `tags`, `notes_for_user`).
        * Shows a status indicator (✓ Done / ✎ Edit) in the list for entries based on whether their placeholder data has been filled.
        * Allows updating entries in memory.
        * Allows exporting the completed metadata as `atlas_metadata.json`.
    * **Current Status:** The HTML and JavaScript for this editor have been created and include the zoomed preview and completion indicators.

## III. Next Planned Step (Immediately Following Current Work)

The next logical step, once the user has successfully used `atlas_editor.html` to create a complete and accurate `Atlas file to game data/atlas_metadata.json`, is to **create and implement the `atlas_data_generator.js` Node.js script.**

**Reference Plan for `atlas_data_generator.js` (from previous discussion):**

* **Purpose:** Reads the user-completed `Atlas file to game data/atlas_metadata.json` and an existing (but potentially minimal) `game_data/bestiary_data.json`. It then generates/updates:
  * `game_data/map_tiles_data.json` (containing definitions for map tiles).
  * The existing `game_data/bestiary_data.json` by adding/updating `atlasCoords` for each creature.
* **Location:** `Atlas file to game data/atlas_data_generator.js`.
* **Inputs:**
  * `Atlas file to game data/atlas_metadata.json`
  * `game_data/bestiary_data.json` (user needs to create this with creature text data; script adds coordinates).
* **Outputs:**
  * `game_data/map_tiles_data.json`
  * `game_data/bestiary_data.json` (updated with coordinates).
* **Logic Outline:**
    1. Require `fs`.
    2. Define input/output paths.
    3. Read and parse `atlas_metadata.json`.
    4. Read and parse `bestiary_data.json`.
    5. Initialize `mapTilesData = { tileTypes: [] }`.
    6. Create a lookup for bestiary entries from `bestiary_data.json`.
    7. Iterate through `definitions` in `atlas_metadata.json`:
        * If `type` is "mapTile", format and add to `mapTilesData.tileTypes`.
        * If `type` is "creatureSprite" and `creatureId` is present, find the creature in the bestiary lookup and add/update its `atlasCoords`. Log warnings if `creatureId` not found in `bestiary_data.json`.
    8. Write `mapTilesData` to `game_data/map_tiles_data.json`.
    9. Write the updated bestiary data back to `game_data/bestiary_data.json`.

## IV. Prompt to Continue

"The `atlas_coordinate_lister.js` and the visual `atlas_editor.html` (with `atlas_editor.js`) have been created to help the user generate a detailed `atlas_metadata.json` file from their `Complete File for All Tiles.png`.

**Your task is to now create the Node.js script `Atlas file to game data/atlas_data_generator.js`.**

This script should:

1. Read the `Atlas file to game data/atlas_metadata.json` (which the user will have completed using the editor).
2. Read a user-maintained `game_data/bestiary_data.json` file (this file will contain creature names, descriptions, stats, etc., but initially no image coordinate data).
3. Process these inputs to:
    a.  Generate a new `game_data/map_tiles_data.json` file. Each entry in this file should correspond to a "mapTile" type definition in `atlas_metadata.json` and include its `id`, `name`, `atlasCoords` (x, y, width, height derived from the atlas metadata and tile dimensions), and any `tags`.
    b.  Update the `game_data/bestiary_data.json` file. For each "creatureSprite" type definition in `atlas_metadata.json` that has a `creatureId`, find the matching creature entry in `bestiary_data.json` (by `id` or `creatureId`) and add or update an `atlasCoords` field with the x, y, width, and height of its sprite from the atlas metadata.
4. Ensure the output JSON files are pretty-printed.
5. Provide console logs for progress and any warnings (e.g., if a `creatureId` from the atlas metadata is not found in the `bestiary_data.json`).

Assume the user has Node.js and will run this script from the `Atlas file to game data/` directory. The `atlas_metadata.json` will define `tileWidth` and `tileHeight` (e.g., 32). The `game_data` folder should be created in the project root (`c:/Users/menel/Desktop/echoes_of_dust/game_data/`).

Please proceed with creating the `atlas_data_generator.js` script."
